            Creating an informed journey is a collaborative project with the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications (LVM) aimed at addressing the vision of the National Transport System Plan 2021-2032 to promote Finlandâ€™s (transportation) competitiveness. In this project, we were tasked with defining the Accessible Travel Chain and envisioning how it will be presented to the public, taking into account the diverse needs of various actors.
