                    I find that garments have this element of being timeless in terms of design and fabric, and there is a desire to be able to wear and use the garment for a lifetime. I do not believe in the concept of a perfect garment, only in the knowledge that you can be absolutely hideous and still look good. I also believe at the end of the day that itâ€™s about the satisfaction of being able to wear something that you love, and not the piece that you wore for eight years.
